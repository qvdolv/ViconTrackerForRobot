<h1>Autonomous Robot using Vitcon Tracker Data</h1>

        <h3>Main idea</h3>
        <p>Users via a web app can order the robot to go to specified locations
            being the robot capable of avoiding obstacles in its path.</p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>

        <p>
            We receive position data from Vicon tracker via wifi communication.
            Then, the data received is processed in order to update the current
            position of the robot.
            The current position, our goal position, and the Arduino feedback, as
            discuss later, are passed as arguments to our baseline trajectory planning
            algorithm. Our algorithm returns specific commands that are send via
            socket to Arduino. Arduino executes the commands (movements) and
            sends feedback data which are the result of the ultrasonic sensor distance
            measures that help us to detect current obstacles*.
            Regarding the interface, the front-end comprehend a web page that
            receives as input the goal position and displays the current path that
            robot is building until it reaches the target goal.

    <p>*Another approach was executing an avoidance algorithm directly in the Arduino sketch, eliminating feedback to the main algorithm.</p>
